###Description
 
  This is the bulk of the front-end code I wrote for the Chilean company, Tuten, SpA during the Summer of 2016.
  
  Tuten is a leading startup in South America, having a B2B partnership with Sodimac (Home Depot of South America), along with a large B2C base. 
  The company is essentially Lyft for household services (plumbing, electric, cleaning, etc). 
  They have a large pool of professionals they connect with consumers based on need and schedule.
  
  My job was to create two user interfaces:
    1) The Client Interface: this allows the client to graphically see where their professional is, and predicts the arrival time using Google Maps API.
    2) The Admin Interface: this allows the company admins to filter out all professionals and clients due to their job-type and date of service (see sample.png)
    
  Both are accessible on mobile and web platforms.
    
  Because there is some sensitive code behind this, the backend (RESTful) is detached, and description will be vague. This project is meant to merely showcase my JS, Angular, jQuery, CSS, and HTML coding style and ability.
  
###Tip Of The Hat
  Much credit to the Google Maps API documentation and stackoverflow for guiding me through this.
